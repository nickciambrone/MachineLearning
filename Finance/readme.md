In this jupyter notebook, I start by importing all of my modules, and then creating start and end date time objects to set the boundaries for my research. 
Then, I read in stock pricing data for six major financial comapnies.
I concatenated all of the DataFrames, then set up multi level indexing to have multiple attributes for each company on every day in the time series. 
Then I added a pct_change column to indicate daily returns.
After that I conducted analysis using data visualization tools. 
In this file I employ my skills in plotly, cufflinks, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, and logic (for cleansing the data).
