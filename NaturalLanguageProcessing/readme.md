In this Jupyter Notebook, I conducted research on a real dataset created by Yelp. This dataset contains information about reviews: the text (the review that the person wrote) and the number of stars they gave. In this notebook, I start by filtering the data to return only the rows where the amount of stars was either 1 or 5, just to make it more simple for my algorithm. Then I created and fit a model that was able to predict the star rating with 92% accuracy. Then, I attempted to improve my pipeline by using the TfidfTransformer() on the text fields; however, this caused a drop in accuracy of 30% when testing on the test data. 

Modules employed: SKlearn, numpy, pandas, seaborn
